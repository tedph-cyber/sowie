## Sincere Apology to Ọ̀rẹ́ mi àtàtà
 

Dear Abigail,

I am writing to you today to express my sincere apologies for my recent actions. I understand that I have hurt you and let you down, and for that, I am truly sorry. My behavior was thoughtless and selfish, and I realize that I have caused you pain and disappointment.

I want you to know that I value our friendship deeply, and I never intended to harm you in any way. I know that I have made a mistake, and I am committed to making things right. I will do whatever it takes to regain your trust and make amends for my actions.

Please know that I am here for you, and I will do everything in my power to support you and be there for you in the future. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and that we can move forward together as friends.

Once again, I am truly sorry for my actions, and I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Sincerely,

TeD
